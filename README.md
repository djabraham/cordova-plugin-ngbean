Cordova Android Plugin for Bean SDK
===

A Cordova plugin, or JavasSript bridge and wrapper class for the native Java based PunchThrough Bean Android SDK.

Created to help my kids and I interact with BLE arduino devices, specifically the PunchThrough LightBlue Bean & Bean+ units. Many of us do not have iPhones, so we created this minimal plugin to enable us to build an HTML5 Android app with the Ionic Framework.

Note that there are no unit tests and we only scratch the surface of what can be done here. If you're interested in a more professional effort that can communicate with various BLE lines, check out the ```cordova-plugin-ble-central``` plugin:

For the full Ionic app that utilizes this LightBlue Bean specific plugin, visit the following repo. You should actually start there too, because the Ionic app will automatically pull this repo when building locally for the first time.
